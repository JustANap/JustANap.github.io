    and
    security components in the design. <br> <br>
    2. Install, configure and test security hardware and software tools with supporting documentation such as port

    policy,
    assessments or troubleshooting procedures. <br> <br>
    5. Develop a research report or implementation plan concerning legal and ethical best practices and mandated
    requirements that pertain to information security. <br> <br>
    6. Research, document, test and evaluate several current industry information security based threats, risks,
    malicious activities, covert methodology, encryption technologies, mitigation techniques or unconventional tactics
